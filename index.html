  <h2>Data Story: Evolution of Metropolitan Public Transport Usage in Australia</h2>

  <p>The visualisation presents monthly patronage trends for metropolitan Train, Tram, and Bus services from 2018 to 2024. It highlights how public transport usage patterns shifted before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <p>Public transport patronage began to decline sharply in March 2020, coinciding with the onset of pandemic-induced lockdowns. The decline persisted until December 2021. This period shows a substantial drop in usage across all transport modes.</p>

  <h3>Pre-Pandemic Trends (2018–Early 2020)</h3>
  <p>Prior to the pandemic, Train services consistently recorded the highest patronage, followed by Tram and Bus services. Seasonal patterns are evident, with slight declines around the December-January period, reflecting reduced commuting during holidays.</p>

  <p>Train services display more pronounced seasonal fluctuations, likely influenced by work and school cycles. Tram and Bus services exhibit steadier trends with moderate seasonal variations.</p>

  <h3>Pandemic Impact (March 2020–December 2021)</h3>
  <p>From March 2020, all transport modes experienced a sharp and simultaneous decline in patronage. Train services were the most affected, with patronage reaching its lowest levels during strict lockdown periods.</p>

  <p>Recovery during this time was slow and unstable, reflecting the intermittent nature of restrictions and changes in commuting behavior. Bus services showed a slightly quicker and more consistent recovery, possibly due to their role in supporting essential travel within local areas.</p>

  <h3>Post-Pandemic Recovery (2022–2024)</h3>
  <p>After the easing of restrictions, patronage began to recover across all modes. However, by 2024, usage levels had not returned to their pre-pandemic peaks. Train services remained below historical levels, indicating possible long-term changes in commuting habits, such as the continuation of remote work.</p>

  <p>Tram and Bus services demonstrated stronger recoveries, with Tram usage in particular returning closer to pre-pandemic patterns. This suggests that localized, short-distance transport modes recovered faster than citywide services like Trains.</p>

  <h3>Mode-Specific Insights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Train:</strong> Experienced the largest drop in patronage and the slowest recovery.</li>
    <li><strong>Tram:</strong> Showed a quicker rebound, likely due to its connection with local commuting and tourism.</li>
    <li><strong>Bus:</strong> Displayed resilience with a smoother recovery, reflecting its importance for essential and short-distance travel.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>The data reveals the profound and lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on metropolitan public transport usage in Australia. It highlights immediate disruptions as well as longer-term shifts in travel behavior, particularly in the use of Train services. The varying recovery patterns among transport modes offer important insights into the resilience of local transit networks and the evolving nature of urban mobility.</p>

      <h2>Data Story: Income Levels and Transport Mode Usage (2021 only)</h2>

      <p>The radar chart explores the relationship between individual income levels and preferred modes of transport. By proportionally normalizing the transport mode usage across different income brackets, the visualization highlights clear trends in transportation preferences based on income.</p>

      <h3>Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Car as Driver:</strong> Dominates across all income levels, with especially high proportions among mid to high-income groups (e.g., $1,250–$3,499 monthly income).</li>
        <li><strong>Car as Passenger:</strong> Higher proportions are noticeable among lower-income groups (below $650 monthly income), suggesting reliance on car-pooling or dependent travel.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Transport (Train, Bus, Tram, Ferry):</strong> Usage shares are relatively more stable across income groups but show modest peaks at lower to mid-income ranges ($300–$799 monthly income).</li>
        <li><strong>Taxi/ E-hailing Services:</strong> Contribute minimally across all income brackets but are slightly more visible in lower-income groups.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The data illustrates a strong correlation between income levels and the choice of transport modes. Individuals with higher incomes predominantly prefer using private vehicles as drivers, indicating greater access to personal vehicles. In contrast, public transport modes maintain a steady share across varying income groups but do not exhibit dominance, underlining accessibility barriers or lifestyle choices influencing commuting patterns. Understanding these trends can inform urban mobility planning and transport policy interventions, especially for lower-income demographics.

  <h2>Data Story: Relationship Between Vehicle Ownership and Transport Mode Patronage</h2>

  <p>This visualization examines how the number of motor vehicles owned correlates with the use of various transport modes, offering insights into public transport dependency and private vehicle reliance across different ownership levels.</p>

  <h3>Key Observations</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Motor Vehicles:</strong> Individuals without access to motor vehicles rely heavily on public transport modes — Train, Bus, and Tram/Light Rail collectively account for a large proportion of their mobility. Train usage is the most prominent, followed closely by Bus patronage.</li>

    <li><strong>One Motor Vehicle:</strong> Households with a single vehicle demonstrate a balanced transport behavior. Car usage (both as driver and passenger) rises significantly, but public transport remains an important mode, especially for Train and Bus commuters.</li>

    <li><strong>Two or More Vehicles:</strong> As vehicle ownership increases to two or more, dependence on private vehicles becomes dominant. 'Car, as driver' patronage dramatically increases, while the proportion of public transport usage sharply declines.</li>

    <li><strong>Three Motor Vehicles:</strong> With three vehicles, the preference for private car usage becomes nearly absolute, with minimal reliance on public transport services. 'Car, as driver' takes up the majority of trips, and Train, Bus, and Tram usage drops to negligible levels.</li>

    <li><strong>Four or More Motor Vehicles:</strong> Households with four or more vehicles exhibit the highest dependency on private cars, leaving public transport modes with the smallest patronage share among all groups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Public Transport vs. Private Vehicle Dynamics</h3>
  <p>The stacked bar chart reveals a strong inverse relationship between the number of vehicles owned and public transport reliance. The fewer the vehicles, the higher the public transport patronage, emphasizing the importance of public transport services in vehicle-constrained households.</p>

  <p>In contrast, households with greater vehicle ownership overwhelmingly shift toward private car usage, suggesting that policies aimed at reducing car dependency must consider incentives for maintaining or enhancing public transport attractiveness even as household affluence (and vehicle ownership) increases.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Exploration Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the <strong>Switch View</strong> button to toggle between Absolute Numbers and Percentage Shares for deeper insights.</li>
    <li>Exclude specific transport modes to observe how the share distribution changes across the remaining modes.</li>
    <li>Hover over each bar segment to see detailed patronage figures and percentages by transport mode.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>This data highlights the critical role public transport plays for individuals with limited or no access to private vehicles. Understanding these patterns helps inform transport policy, urban planning, and sustainability strategies aimed at balancing mobility needs with congestion and environmental goals.</p>
